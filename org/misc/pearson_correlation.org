* Pearson correlation coefficient

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient][Pearson correlation coefficient - Wikipedia]]

In [[/wiki/Statistics][statistics]], the *Pearson correlation
coefficient* (*PCC*, pronounced [[/wiki/Help:IPA/English][/ˈpɪərsən/]])
― also known as *Pearson's /r/*, the *Pearson product-moment correlation
coefficient* (*PPMCC*), the *bivariate
correlation*, or colloquially simply as *the
correlation coefficient* ― is a measure of
[[/wiki/Linear][linear]]
[[/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence][correlation]] between two sets of
data. It is the ratio between the [[/wiki/Covariance][covariance]] of
two variables and the product of their
[[/wiki/Standard_deviation][standard deviations]]; thus it is
essentially a normalised measurement of the covariance, such that the
result always has a value between −1 and 1. As with covariance itself,
the measure can only reflect a linear correlation of variables, and
ignores many other types of relationship or correlation. As a simple
example, one would expect the age and height of a sample of teenagers
from a high school to have a Pearson correlation coefficient
significantly greater than 0, but less than 1 (as 1 would represent an
unrealistically perfect correlation).

Examples of scatter diagrams with different values of correlation
coefficient (/ρ/)

Several sets of (/x/, /y/) points, with the correlation coefficient of
/x/ and /y/ for each set. Note that the correlation reflects the
strength and direction of a linear relationship (top row), but not the
slope of that relationship (middle), nor many aspects of nonlinear
relationships (bottom). N.B.: the figure in the center has a slope of 0
but in that case the correlation coefficient is undefined because the
variance of /Y/ is zero.

** Naming and history

It was developed by [[/wiki/Karl_Pearson][Karl Pearson]] from a related
idea introduced by [[/wiki/Francis_Galton][Francis Galton]] in the
1880s, and for which the mathematical formula was derived and published
by [[/wiki/Auguste_Bravais][Auguste Bravais]]
in 1844.
The naming of the coefficient is thus an example of
[[/wiki/Stigler%27s_Law][Stigler's Law]].

** Definition[[[/w/index.php?title=Pearson_correlation_coefficient&action=edit&section=2][edit]]]

Pearson's correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables
divided by the product of their standard deviations. The form of the
definition involves a "product moment", that is, the mean (the first
[[/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)][moment]] about the origin) of the product
of the mean-adjusted random variables; hence the modifier
/product-moment/ in the name.

*** For a population

Pearson's correlation coefficient, when applied to a
[[/wiki/Statistical_population][population]], is commonly represented by
the Greek letter /ρ/ (rho) and may be referred to as the /population
correlation coefficient/ or the /population Pearson correlation
coefficient/. Given a pair of random variables
\((X,Y)\)
the formula for /ρ/
is:

\(\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{{cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_{X}\sigma_{Y}}\)

where:

- \(cov\)
  is the covariance
- \(\sigma_{X}\)
  is the standard deviation of
  \(X\)
- \(\sigma_{Y}\)
  is the standard deviation of
  \(Y\)

The formula for
\(\rho\)
can be expressed in terms of mean and expectation.
Since

\({cov}(X,Y) = \mathbb{E}\lbrack(X - \mu_{X})(Y - \mu_{Y})\rbrack,\)
the formula for
\(\rho\)[[
can also be written as

 \(\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\mathbb{E}\lbrack(X - \mu_{X})(Y - \mu_{Y})\rbrack}{\sigma_{X}\sigma_{Y}}\)
|                                                                                                                                                                                                      | |   |   |   | |          |

where:

- \(\sigma_{Y}\)
  and
  \(\sigma_{X}\)
  are defined as above
- \(\mu_{X}\)  is the [[/wiki/Mean][mean]] of
  \(X\)
- \(\mu_{Y}\)
  is the mean of
  \(Y\)
- \(\mathbb{E}\)  is the [[/wiki/Expected_Value][expectation]].

The formula for
\(\rho\)[[
can be expressed in terms of uncentered moments. Since

\(\mu_{X} = \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X\,\rbrack\)
\(\mu_{Y} = \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, Y\,\rbrack\)
\(\sigma_{X}^{2} = \mathbb{E}\lbrack\,\left( {X - \mathbb{E}\lbrack X\rbrack} \right)^{2}\,\rbrack = \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X^{2}\,\rbrack - \left( {\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X\,\rbrack} \right)^{2}\)
\(\sigma_{Y}^{2} = \mathbb{E}\lbrack\,\left( {Y - \mathbb{E}\lbrack Y\rbrack} \right)^{2}\,\rbrack = \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, Y^{2}\,\rbrack - \left( {\,\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, Y\,\rbrack} \right)^{2}\)
\(\mathbb{E}\lbrack\,\left( {X - \mu_{X}} \right)\left( {Y - \mu_{Y}} \right)\,\rbrack = \mathbb{E}\lbrack\,\left( {X - \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X\,\rbrack} \right)\left( {Y - \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, Y\,\rbrack} \right)\,\rbrack = \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X\, Y\,\rbrack - \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X\,\rbrack\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, Y\,\rbrack\,,\)
the formula for
\(\rho\)
can also be written as

\[\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X\, Y\,\rbrack - \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X\,\rbrack\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, Y\,\rbrack}{\sqrt{\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X^{2}\,\rbrack - \left( {\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X\,\rbrack} \right)^{2}}\ \sqrt{\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, Y^{2}\,\rbrack - \left( {\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, Y\,\rbrack} \right)^{2}}}.\]

*** For a sample

Pearson's correlation coefficient, when applied to a
[[/wiki/Sample_(statistics)][sample]], is commonly represented by
\(r_{xy}\)
and may be referred to as the /sample correlation coefficient/ or the
/sample Pearson correlation coefficient/. We can obtain a formula for
\(r_{xy}\)
by substituting estimates of the covariances and variances based on a
sample into the formula above. Given paired data
\(\left\{ {(x_{1},y_{1}),\ldots,(x_{n},y_{n})} \right\}\)
consisting of
\(n\)
pairs,
\(r_{xy}\)
is defined as:

 \(r_{xy} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}(x_{i} - \overline{x})(y_{i} - \overline{y})}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}(x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2}}\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}(y_{i} - \overline{y})^{2}}}\)

where:

- \(n\)
  is sample size
- \(x_{i},y_{i}\)
  are the individual sample points indexed with /i/
- \(\overline{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}\)
  (the sample mean); and analogously for
  \(\overline{y}\)[[

Rearranging gives us this formula for
\(r_{xy}\)

\(r_{xy} = \frac{n\sum x_{i}y_{i} - \sum x_{i}\sum y_{i}}{\sqrt{n\sum x_{i}^{2} - \left( {\sum x_{i}} \right)^{2}}\ \sqrt{n\sum y_{i}^{2} - \left( {\sum y_{i}} \right)^{2}}}.\)
where
\(n,x_{i},y_{i}\)
are defined as above.

This formula suggests a convenient single-pass algorithm for calculating
sample correlations, though depending on the numbers involved, it can
sometimes be [[/wiki/Numerical_stability][numerically unstable]].

Rearranging again gives us this
formula for
\(r_{xy}\)

\(r_{xy} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i}x_{i}y_{i} - n\overline{x}\overline{y}}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i}x_{i}^{2} - n{\overline{x}}^{2}}\ \sqrt{\sum\limits_{i}y_{i}^{2} - n{\overline{y}}^{2}}}.\)
where
\(n,x_{i},y_{i},\overline{x},\overline{y}\)
are defined as above.

An equivalent expression gives the formula for
\(r_{xy}\)
as the mean of the products of the [[/wiki/Standard_score][standard
scores]] as follows:

\(r_{xy} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\left( \frac{x_{i} - \overline{x}}{s_{x}} \right)\left( \frac{y_{i} - \overline{y}}{s_{y}} \right)\)
where:

- \(n,x_{i},y_{i},\overline{x},\overline{y}\)
  are defined as above, and
  \(s_{x},s_{y}\)
  are defined below
- \(\left( \frac{x_{i} - \overline{x}}{s_{x}} \right)\)
  is the standard score (and analogously for the standard score of
  \(y\)

Alternative formulae for
\(r_{xy}\)
are also available. For example. one can use the following formula for
\(r_{xy}\)

\(r_{xy} = \frac{\sum x_{i}y_{i} - n\overline{x}\overline{y}}{(n - 1)s_{x}s_{y}}\)
where:

- \(n,x_{i},y_{i},\overline{x},\overline{y}\)
  are defined as above and:
- \(s_{x} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}(x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2}}\)
  (the sample standard deviation); and analogously for
  \(s_{y}\)

*** Practical issues

Under heavy noise conditions, extracting the correlation coefficient
between two sets of [[/wiki/Random_variables][stochastic variables]] is
nontrivial, in particular where Canonical Correlation Analysis reports
degraded correlation values due to the heavy noise contributions. A
generalization of the approach is given
elsewhere.

In case of missing data, Garren derived the
[[/wiki/Maximum_likelihood][maximum likelihood]]
estimator.

** Mathematicalproperties

The absolute values of both the sample and population Pearson
correlation coefficients are on or between −1 and 1. Correlations equal
to +1 or −1 correspond to data points lying exactly on a line (in the
case of the sample correlation), or to a bivariate distribution entirely
supported on a line (in the case of the population correlation). The
Pearson correlation coefficient is symmetric:
corr(/X/,/Y/) = corr(/Y/,/X/).

A key mathematical property of the Pearson correlation coefficient is
that it is [[/wiki/Invariant_estimator][invariant]] under separate
changes in location and scale in the two variables. That is, we may
transform /X/ to /a/ + /bX/ and transform /Y/ to /c/ + /dY/, where /a/,
/b/, /c/, and /d/ are constants with /b/, /d/ > 0, without changing the
correlation coefficient. (This holds for both the population and sample
Pearson correlation coefficients.) Note that more general linear
transformations do change the correlation: see
[[/Decorrelation_of_n_random_variables][§ Decorrelation of n randomvariables]] for an application of this.

** Interpretation

The correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to 1. An absolute value of
exactly 1 implies that a linear equation describes the relationship
between /X/ and /Y/ perfectly, with all data points lying on a
[[/wiki/Line_(mathematics)][line]]. The correlation sign is determined
by the [[/wiki/Regression_slope][regression slope]]: a value of +1
implies that all data points lie on a line for which /Y/ increases as
/X/ increases, and vice versa for −1.
A value of 0 implies that there is no linear dependency between the
variables.

More generally, note that (/X/_{/i/} − /X/)(/Y/_{/i/} − /Y/) is positive
if and only if /X/_{/i/} and /Y/_{/i/} lie on the same side of their
respective means. Thus the correlation coefficient is positive if
/X/_{/i/} and /Y/_{/i/} tend to be simultaneously greater than, or
simultaneously less than, their respective means. The correlation
coefficient is negative ([[/wiki/Anti-correlation][anti-correlation]])
if /X/_{/i/} and /Y/_{/i/} tend to lie on opposite sides of their
respective means. Moreover, the stronger is either tendency, the larger
is the [[/wiki/Absolute_value][absolute value]] of the correlation
coefficient.

Rodgers and Nicewander cataloged thirteen ways
of interpreting correlation or simple functions of it:

- Function of raw scores and means
- Standardized covariance
- Standardized slope of the regression line
- Geometric mean of the two regression slopes
- Square root of the ratio of two variances
- Mean cross-product of standardized variables
- Function of the angle between two standardized regression lines
- Function of the angle between two variable vectors
- Rescaled variance of the difference between standardized scores
- Estimated from the balloon rule
- Related to the bivariate ellipses of isoconcentration
- Function of test statistics from designed experiments
- Ratio of two means

[[/wiki/File:Regression_lines.png][]]

Regression lines for /y/ = /g/_{/X/}(/x/) [red] and /x/ = /g/_{/Y/}(/y/)
[blue]

For uncentered data, there is a relation between the correlation
coefficient and the angle /φ/ between the two regression lines, /y/ =
/g/_{/X/}(/x/) and /x/ = /g/_{/Y/}(/y/), obtained by regressing /y/ on
/x/ and /x/ on /y/ respectively. (Here, /φ/ is measured counterclockwise
within the first quadrant formed around the lines' intersection point if
/r/ > 0, or counterclockwise from the fourth to the second quadrant if
/r/ < 0.) One can show that if the standard
deviations are equal, then /r/ = sec /φ/ − tan /φ/, where sec and tan
are [[/wiki/Trigonometric_functions][trigonometric functions]].

For centered data (i.e., data which have been shifted by the sample
means of their respective variables so as to have an average of zero for
each variable), the correlation coefficient can also be viewed as the
[[/wiki/Cosine][cosine]] of the [[/wiki/Angle][angle]] /θ/ between the
two observed [[/wiki/Vector_(geometry)][vectors]] in /N/-dimensional
space (for /N/ observations of each variable)

Both the uncentered (non-Pearson-compliant) and centered correlation
coefficients can be determined for a dataset. As an example, suppose
five countries are found to have gross national products of 1, 2, 3, 5,
and 8 billion dollars, respectively. Suppose these same five countries
(in the same order) are found to have 11%, 12%, 13%, 15%, and 18%
poverty. Then let *x* and *y* be ordered 5-element vectors containing
the above data: *x* = (1, 2, 3, 5, 8) and *y* = (0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.15,
0.18).

By the usual procedure for finding the angle /θ/ between two vectors
(see [[/wiki/Dot_product][dot product]]), the /uncentered/ correlation
coefficient is:

\(\cos\theta = \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}}{\left\| \mathbf{x} \right\|\left\| \mathbf{y} \right\|} = \frac{2.93}{\sqrt{103}\sqrt{0.0983}} = 0.920814711.\)
This uncentered correlation coefficient is identical with the
[[/wiki/Cosine_similarity][cosine similarity]]. Note that the above data
were deliberately chosen to be perfectly correlated: /y/ = 0.10 + 0.01
/x/. The Pearson correlation coefficient must therefore be exactly one.
Centering the data (shifting *x* by ℰ(*x*) = 3.8 and *y* by ℰ(*y*) =
0.138) yields *x* = (−2.8, −1.8, −0.8, 1.2, 4.2) and *y* = (−0.028,
−0.018, −0.008, 0.012, 0.042), from which

\(\cos\theta = \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}}{\left\| \mathbf{x} \right\|\left\| \mathbf{y} \right\|} = \frac{0.308}{\sqrt{30.8}\sqrt{0.00308}} = 1 = \rho_{xy},\)
as expected.

[[/wiki/File:Pearson_correlation_and_prediction_intervals.svg][]]

This figure gives a sense of how the usefulness of a Pearson correlation
for predicting values varies with its magnitude. Given jointly normal
/X/, /Y/ with correlation /ρ/,
\(1 - \sqrt{1 - \rho^{2}}\)
(plotted here as a function of /ρ/) is the factor by which a given
[[/wiki/Prediction_interval][prediction interval]] for /Y/ may be
reduced given the corresponding value of /X/. For example, if /ρ/ = 0.5,
then the 95% prediction interval of /Y/|/X/ will be about 13% smaller
than the 95% prediction interval of /Y/.

Several authors have offered guidelines for the interpretation of a
correlation
coefficient.
However, all such criteria are in some ways
arbitrary. The interpretation of a
correlation coefficient depends on the context and purposes. A
correlation of 0.8 may be very low if one is verifying a physical law
using high-quality instruments, but may be regarded as very high in the
social sciences, where there may be a greater contribution from
complicating factors.

** Inference

Statistical inference based on Pearson's correlation coefficient often
focuses on one of the following two aims:

- One aim is to test the [[/wiki/Null_hypothesis][null hypothesis]] that
  the true correlation coefficient /ρ/ is equal to 0, based on the value
  of the sample correlation coefficient /r/.
- The other aim is to derive a [[/wiki/Confidence_interval][confidence
  interval]] that, on repeated sampling, has a given probability of
  containing /ρ/.

We discuss methods of achieving one or both of these aims below.

*** Using a permutation test

Permutation tests provide a direct approach to performing hypothesis
tests and constructing confidence intervals. A permutation test for
Pearson's correlation coefficient involves the following two steps:

1. Using the original paired data (/x/_{/i/}, /y/_{/i/}), randomly
   redefine the pairs to create a new data set (/x/_{/i/}, /y/_{/i′/}),
   where the /i′/ are a permutation of the set {1,...,/n/}. The
   permutation /i′/ is selected randomly, with equal probabilities
   placed on all /n/! possible permutations. This is equivalent to
   drawing the /i′/ randomly without replacement from the set {1, ...,
   /n/}. In [[/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)][bootstrapping]], a
   closely related approach, the /i/ and the /i′/ are equal and drawn
   with replacement from {1, ..., /n/};
2. Construct a correlation coefficient /r/ from the randomized data.

To perform the permutation test, repeat steps (1) and (2) a large number
of times. The [[/wiki/P-value][p-value]] for the permutation test is the
proportion of the /r/ values generated in step (2) that are larger than
the Pearson correlation coefficient that was calculated from the
original data. Here "larger" can mean either that the value is larger in
magnitude, or larger in signed value, depending on whether a
[[/wiki/Two-tailed_test][two-sided]] or
[[/wiki/Two-tailed_test][one-sided]] test is desired.

*** Using a bootstrap

The [[/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)][bootstrap]] can be used to
construct confidence intervals for Pearson's correlation coefficient. In
the "non-parametric" bootstrap, /n/ pairs (/x/_{/i/}, /y/_{/i/}) are
resampled "with replacement" from the observed set of /n/ pairs, and the
correlation coefficient /r/ is calculated based on the resampled data.
This process is repeated a large number of times, and the empirical
distribution of the resampled /r/ values are used to approximate the
[[/wiki/Sampling_distribution][sampling distribution]] of the statistic.
A 95% [[/wiki/Confidence_interval][confidence interval]] for /ρ/ can be
defined as the interval spanning from the 2.5th to the 97.5th
[[/wiki/Percentile][percentile]] of the resampled /r/ values.

*** Testing using Student's/t-distribution


[[/wiki/File:Critical_correlation_vs._sample_size.svg][[[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Critical_correlation_vs._sample_size.svg/324px-Critical_correlation_vs._sample_size.svg.png]]]]

[[/wiki/File:Critical_correlation_vs._sample_size.svg][]]

Critical values of Pearson's correlation coefficient that must be
exceeded to be considered significantly nonzero at the 0.05 level.

For pairs from an uncorrelated
[[/wiki/Bivariate_normal_distribution][bivariate normal distribution]],
the [[/wiki/Sampling_distribution][sampling distribution]] of a certain
function of Pearson's correlation coefficient follows
[[/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution][Student's /t/-distribution]] with
degrees of freedom /n/ − 2. Specifically, if the underlying variables
have a bivariate normal distribution, the variable

\(t = r\sqrt{\frac{n - 2}{1 - r^{2}}}\)
has a student's /t/-distribution in the null case (zero
correlation). This holds approximately in case
of non-normal observed values if sample sizes are large
enough. For determining the critical values
for /r/ the inverse function is needed:

\(r = \frac{t}{\sqrt{n - 2 + t^{2}}}.\)
Alternatively, large sample, asymptotic approaches can be used.

Another early paper provides graphs and tables
for general values of /ρ/, for small sample sizes, and discusses
computational approaches.

In the case where the underlying variables are not normal, the sampling
distribution of Pearson's correlation coefficient follows a Student's
/t/-distribution, but the degrees of freedom are
reduced.

*** Using the exact istribution

For data that follow a [[/wiki/Bivariate_normal_distribution][bivariates
normal distribution]], the exact density function /f/(/r/) for the
sample correlation coefficient /r/ of a normal bivariate
is

\(f(r) = \frac{(n - 2)\,\Gamma(n - 1)(1 - \rho^{2})^{\frac{n - 1}{2}}(1 - r^{2})^{\frac{n - 4}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}\,\Gamma(n - \frac{1}{2})(1 - \rho r)^{n - \frac{3}{2}}}{}_{2}F_{1}(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2};\frac{1}{2}(2n - 1);\frac{1}{2}(\rho r + 1))\)
where
\(\Gamma\)
is the [[/wiki/Gamma_function][gamma function]] and
\({}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)\)
is the [[/wiki/Hypergeometric_function][Gaussian hypergeometric
function]].

In the special case when
\(\rho = 0\)
the exact density function /f/(/r/) can be written as:

\(f(r) = \frac{\left( {1 - r^{2}} \right)^{\frac{n - 4}{2}}}{B\left( {\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}(n - 2)} \right)},\)
where
\(B\)
is the [[/wiki/Beta_function][beta function]], which is one way of
writing the density of a Student's t-distribution, as above.

*** Using the exact confidence distribution

Confidence intervals and tests can be calculated from a
[[/wiki/Confidence_distribution][confidence distribution]]. An exact
confidence density for /ρ/ is

\[\pi(\rho|r) = \frac{\nu(\nu - 1)\Gamma(\nu - 1)}{\sqrt{2\pi}\Gamma(\nu + \frac{1}{2})}(1 - r^{2})^{\frac{\nu - 1}{2}} \cdot (1 - \rho^{2})^{\frac{\nu - 2}{2}} \cdot (1 - r\rho)^{\frac{1 - 2\nu}{2}}F\left( {\frac{3}{2}, - \frac{1}{2};\nu + \frac{1}{2};\frac{1 + r\rho}{2}} \right)\]



where
\(F\)
is the Gaussian hypergeometric function and
\(\nu = n - 1 > 1\)

*** Using the Fisher transformation

In practice, [[/wiki/Confidence_intervals][confidence intervals]] and
[[/wiki/Hypothesis_test][hypothesis tests]] relating to /ρ/ are usually
carried out using the [[/wiki/Fisher_transformation][Fisher
transformation]],
\(F\)

\(F(r) \equiv \frac{1}{2}\,\ln\left( \frac{1 + r}{1 - r} \right) = {artanh}(r)\)
/F/(/r/) approximately follows a [[/wiki/Normal_distribution][normal
distribution]] with

\(\text{mean} = F(\rho) = {artanh}(\rho)\)
[[/wiki/Standard_error][standard error]]
\(= \text{SE} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n - 3}},\)
where /n/ is the sample size. The approximation error is lowest for a
large sample size
\(n\)
and small
\(r\)
and
\(\rho_{0}\)
and increases otherwise.

Using the approximation, a [[/wiki/Standard_score][z-score]] is

\(z = \frac{x - \text{mean}}{\text{SE}} = \lbrack F(r) - F(\rho_{0})\rbrack\sqrt{n - 3}\)
under the [[/wiki/Null_hypothesis][null hypothesis]] that
\(\rho = \rho_{0}\)
given the assumption that the sample pairs are
[[/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed][independent and
identically distributed]] and follow a
[[/wiki/Bivariate_normal_distribution][bivariate normal distribution]].
Thus an approximate [[/wiki/P-value][p-value]] can be obtained from a
normal probability table. For example, if /z/ = 2.2 is observed and a
two-sided p-value is desired to test the null hypothesis that
\(\rho = 0\)
the p-value is 2 Φ(−2.2) = 0.028, where Φ is the standard normal
[[/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function][cumulative distribution
function]].

To obtain a confidence interval for ρ, we first compute a confidence
interval for
/F/(/\(\rho\)

\(100(1 - \alpha)\%\text{CI}:{artanh}(\rho) \in \lbrack{artanh}(r) \pm z_{\alpha/2}\text{SE}\rbrack\)
The inverse Fisher transformation brings the interval back to the
correlation scale.

\(100(1 - \alpha)\%\text{CI}:\rho \in \lbrack\tanh({artanh}(r) - z_{\alpha/2}\text{SE}),\tanh({artanh}(r) + z_{\alpha/2}\text{SE})\rbrack\)
For example, suppose we observe /r/ = 0.3 with a sample size of /n/=50,
and we wish to obtain a 95% confidence interval for ρ. The transformed
value is arctanh(/r/) = 0.30952, so the confidence interval on the
transformed scale is 0.30952 ± 1.96/√47, or (0.023624, 0.595415).
Converting back to the correlation scale yields (0.024, 0.534).

** In least squares regression analysis

For more general, non-linear dependency, see
[[/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination#In_a_non-simple_linear_model][Coefficient
of determination § In a non-simple linear model]].

The square of the sample correlation coefficient is typically denoted
/r/^{2} and is a special case of the
[[/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination][coefficient of determination]]. In
this case, it estimates the fraction of the variance in /Y/ that is
explained by /X/ in a [[/wiki/Simple_linear_regression][simple linear
regression]]. So if we have the observed dataset
\(Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{n}\)
and the fitted dataset
\({\hat{Y}}_{1},\ldots,{\hat{Y}}_{n}\)
then as a starting point the total variation in the /Y/_{/i/} around
their average value can be decomposed as follows

\(\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2} = \sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - {\hat{Y}}_{i})^{2} + \sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2},\)
where the
\({\hat{Y}}_{i}\)
are the fitted values from the regression analysis. This can be
rearranged to give

\(1 = \frac{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - {\hat{Y}}_{i})^{2}}{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}} + \frac{\sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}.\)
The two summands above are the fraction of variance in /Y/ that is
explained by /X/ (right) and that is unexplained by /X/ (left).

Next, we apply a property of least square regression models, that the
sample covariance between
\({\hat{Y}}_{i}\)
and
\(Y_{i} - {\hat{Y}}_{i}\)
is zero. Thus, the sample correlation coefficient between the observed
and fitted response values in the regression can be written (calculation
is under expectation, assumes Gaussian statistics)

\(\begin{matrix}
{r(Y,\hat{Y})} & {= \frac{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2} \cdot \sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}}} \\
 & {= \frac{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - {\hat{Y}}_{i} + {\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2} \cdot \sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}}} \\
 & {= \frac{\sum\limits_{i}\lbrack(Y_{i} - {\hat{Y}}_{i})({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y}) + ({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}\rbrack}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2} \cdot \sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}}} \\
 & {= \frac{\sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2} \cdot \sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}}} \\
 & {= \sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}}.} \\
\end{matrix}\)
Thus

\(r(Y,\hat{Y})^{2} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}{\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}}\)
where
\(r(Y,\hat{Y})^{2}\)
is the proportion of variance in /Y/ explained by a linear function of
/X/.

In the derivation above, the fact that

\(\sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - {\hat{Y}}_{i})({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y}) = 0\)
can be proved by noticing that the partial derivatives of the
[[/wiki/Residual_sum_of_squares][residual sum of squares]] (RSS) over
/β/_{0} and /β/_{1} are equal to 0 in the least squares model, where

\(\text{RSS} = \sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - {\hat{Y}}_{i})^{2}\)
In the end, the equation can be written as:

\(r(Y,\hat{Y})^{2} = \frac{\text{SS}_{\text{reg}}}{\text{SS}_{\text{tot}}}\)
where

- \(\text{SS}_{\text{reg}} = \sum\limits_{i}({\hat{Y}}_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}\)
- \(\text{SS}_{\text{tot}} = \sum\limits_{i}(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})^{2}\)

The symbol
\(\text{SS}_{\text{reg}}\)
is called the regression sum of squares, also called the
[[/wiki/Explained_sum_of_squares][explained sum of squares]], and
\(\text{SS}_{\text{tot}}\)
is the [[/wiki/Total_sum_of_squares][total sum of squares]]
(proportional to the [[/wiki/Variance][variance]] of the data).

** Sensitivity to the data distribution

Further information:
[[/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#Sensitivity_to_the_data_distribution][Correlation
and dependence § Sensitivity to the data distribution]]

*** Existence

The population Pearson correlation coefficient is defined in terms of
[[/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)][moments]], and therefore exists for any
bivariate [[/wiki/Probability_distribution][probability distribution]]
for which the [[/wiki/Statistical_population][population]]
[[/wiki/Covariance][covariance]] is defined and the
[[/wiki/Marginal_distribution][marginal]]
[[/wiki/Population_variance][population variances]] are defined and are
non-zero. Some probability distributions such as the
[[/wiki/Cauchy_distribution][Cauchy distribution]] have undefined
variance and hence ρ is not defined if /X/ or /Y/ follows such a
distribution. In some practical applications, such as those involving
data suspected to follow a
[[/wiki/Heavy-tailed_distribution][heavy-tailed distribution]], this is
an important consideration. However, the existence of the correlation
coefficient is usually not a concern; for instance, if the range of the
distribution is bounded, ρ is always defined.

*** Sample size

- If the sample size is moderate or large and the population is normal,
  then, in the case of the bivariate [[/wiki/Normal_distribution][normal
  distribution]], the sample correlation coefficient is the
  [[/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimate][maximum likelihood estimate]] of
  the population correlation coefficient, and is
  [[/wiki/Asymptotic_distribution][asymptotically]]
  [[/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator][unbiased]] and
  [[/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)][efficient]], which roughly means that
  it is impossible to construct a more accurate estimate than the sample
  correlation coefficient.
- If the sample size is large and the population is not normal, then the
  sample correlation coefficient remains approximately unbiased, but may
  not be efficient.
- If the sample size is large, then the sample correlation coefficient
  is a [[/wiki/Consistent_estimator][consistent estimator]] of the
  population correlation coefficient as long as the sample means,
  variances, and covariance are consistent (which is guaranteed when the
  [[/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers][law of large numbers]] can be applied).
- If the sample size is small, then the sample correlation coefficient
  /r/ is not an unbiased estimate of
  /ρ/. The adjusted correlation
  coefficient must be used instead: see elsewhere in this article for
  the definition.
- Correlations can be different for imbalanced
  [[/wiki/Dichotomous_variable][dichotomous]] data when there is
  variance error in sample.

*** Robustness

Like many commonly used statistics, the sample statistic /r/ is not
[[/wiki/Robust_statistics][robust]], so
its value can be misleading if [[/wiki/Outlier][outliers]] are
present. Specifically,
the PMCC is neither distributionally
robust,^{[/[[/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation needed]]/]} nor
outlier resistant (see
[[/wiki/Robust_statistics#Definition][Robust statistics#Definition]]).
Inspection of the [[/wiki/Scatterplot][scatterplot]] between /X/ and /Y/
will typically reveal a situation where lack of robustness might be an
issue, and in such cases it may be advisable to use a robust measure of
association. Note however that while most robust estimators of
association measure [[/wiki/Statistical_dependence][statistical
dependence]] in some way, they are generally not interpretable on the
same scale as the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Statistical inference for Pearson's correlation coefficient is sensitive
to the data distribution. Exact tests, and asymptotic tests based on the
[[/wiki/Fisher_transformation][Fisher transformation]] can be applied if
the data are approximately normally distributed, but may be misleading
otherwise. In some situations, the
[[/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)][bootstrap]] can be applied to
construct confidence intervals, and
[[/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)][permutation tests]] can be applied to
carry out hypothesis tests. These
[[/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics][non-parametric]] approaches may give
more meaningful results in some situations where bivariate normality
does not hold. However the standard versions of these approaches rely on
[[/wiki/Exchangeable_random_variables][exchangeability]] of the data,
meaning that there is no ordering or grouping of the data pairs being
analyzed that might affect the behavior of the correlation estimate.

A stratified analysis is one way to either accommodate a lack of
bivariate normality, or to isolate the correlation resulting from one
factor while controlling for another. If /W/ represents cluster
membership or another factor that it is desirable to control, we can
stratify the data based on the value of /W/, then calculate a
correlation coefficient within each stratum. The stratum-level estimates
can then be combined to estimate the overall correlation while
controlling for /W/.

** Variants

See also:
[[/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#Other_measures_of_dependence_among_random_variables][Correlation
and dependence § Other measures of dependence among random variables]]

Variations of the correlation coefficient can be calculated for
different purposes. Here are some examples.

*** Adjusted correlation coefficient

The sample correlation coefficient r is not an unbiased estimate of ρ.
For data that follows a [[/wiki/Bivariate_normal_distribution][bivariate
normal distribution]], the expectation E[/r/] for the sample correlation
coefficient r of a normal bivariate is

\(\mathbb{E}\lbrack r\rbrack = \rho - \frac{\rho\left( {1 - \rho^{2}} \right)}{2n} + \cdots,\quad\)
therefore r is a biased estimator of
\(\rho.\)
The unique minimum variance unbiased estimator /r/_{adj} is given
by

\(r_{\text{adj}} = r\,{_{2}\mathbf{F}_{1}}\left( {\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2};\frac{n - 1}{2};1 - r^{2}} \right),\)


where:

- \(r,n\)
  are defined as above,
- \({_{2}\mathbf{F}_{1}}(a,b;c;z)\)
  is the [[/wiki/Hypergeometric_function][Gaussian hypergeometric
  function]].

An approximately unbiased estimator /r/_{adj} can be
obtained^{[/[[/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation needed]]/]} by
truncating E[/r/] and solving this truncated equation:

| \(r = \mathbb{E}\lbrack r\rbrack \approx r_{\text{adj}} - \frac{r_{\text{adj}}(1 - r_{\text{adj}}^{2})}{2n}.\)
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | |   |   |   | |       |

An approximate solution^{[/[[/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation
needed]]/]} to equation (*[[/math_2][2]]*) is:

| \(r_{\text{adj}} \approx r\left\lbrack {1 + \frac{1 - r^{2}}{2n}} \right\rbrack,\)
|                                                                                                                                                                                        | |   |   |   | |       |

where in (*[[/math_3][3]]*):

- \(r,n\)
  are defined as above,
- /r/_{adj} is a suboptimal
  estimator,^{[/[[/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation
  needed]]/][/[[/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify][clarification
  needed]]/]}
- /r/_{adj} can also be obtained by maximizing log(/f/(/r/)),
- /r/_{adj} has minimum variance for large values of n,
- /r/_{adj} has a bias of order
  1⁄(/n/ − 1).

Another proposed adjusted
correlation coefficient
is:^{[/[[/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation needed]]/]}

\(r_{\text{adj}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1 - r^{2})(n - 1)}{(n - 2)}}.\)
Note that /r/_{adj} ≈ /r/ for large values of n.

*** Weighted correlation coefficient

Suppose observations to be correlated have differing degrees of
importance that can be expressed with a weight vector /w/. To calculate
the correlation between vectors /x/ and /y/ with the weight vector /w/
(all of length /n/),

- Weighted mean:

  \[m(x;w) = \frac{\sum\limits_{i}w_{i}x_{i}}{\sum\limits_{i}w_{i}}.\]

  

- Weighted covariance

  \[{cov}(x,y;w) = \frac{\sum\limits_{i}w_{i} \cdot (x_{i} - m(x;w))(y_{i} - m(y;w))}{\sum\limits_{i}w_{i}}.\]

  

- Weighted correlation

  \[{corr}(x,y;w) = \frac{{cov}(x,y;w)}{\sqrt{{cov}(x,x;w){cov}(y,y;w)}}.\]

  

*** Reflective correlation

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: reflective-correlation-coefficientedit
    :END:
The reflective correlation is a variant of Pearson's correlation in
which the data are not centered around their mean
values.^{[/[[/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation needed]]/]} The
population reflective correlation is

\({corr}_{r}(X,Y) = \frac{\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X\, Y\,\rbrack}{\sqrt{\mathbb{E}\lbrack\, X^{2}\,\rbrack \cdot \mathbb{E}\lbrack\, Y^{2}\,\rbrack}}.\)
The reflective correlation is symmetric, but it is not invariant under
translation:

\({corr}_{r}(X,Y) = {corr}_{r}(Y,X) = {corr}_{r}(X,bY) \neq {corr}_{r}(X,a + bY),\quad a \neq 0,b > 0.\)
The sample reflective correlation is equivalent to
[[/wiki/Cosine_similarity][cosine similarity]]:

\(rr_{xy} = \frac{\sum x_{i}y_{i}}{\sqrt{(\sum x_{i}^{2})(\sum y_{i}^{2})}}.\)
The weighted version of the sample reflective correlation is

\(rr_{xy,w} = \frac{\sum w_{i}x_{i}y_{i}}{\sqrt{(\sum w_{i}x_{i}^{2})(\sum w_{i}y_{i}^{2})}}.\)
*** Scaled correlation

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: scaled-correlation-coefficientedit
    :END:

Main article: [[/wiki/Scaled_correlation][Scaled correlation]]

Scaled correlation is a variant of Pearson's correlation in which the
range of the data is restricted intentionally and in a controlled manner
to reveal correlations between fast components in time
series. Scaled correlation is
defined as average correlation across short segments of data.

Let
\(K\)
be the number of segments that can fit into the total length of the
signal
\(T\)
for a given scale
\(s\)

\(K = {round}\left( \frac{T}{s} \right).\)
The scaled correlation across the entire signals
\({\overline{r}}_{s}\)
is then computed as

\({\overline{r}}_{s} = \frac{1}{K}\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{K}r_{k},\)
where
\(r_{k}\)
is Pearson's coefficient of correlation for segment
\(k\)

By choosing the parameter
\(s\)
the range of values is reduced and the correlations on long time scale
are filtered out, only the correlations on short time scales being
revealed. Thus, the contributions of slow components are removed and
those of fast components are retained.

    :PROPERTIES:

A distance metric for two variables X and Y known as /Pearson's
distance/ can be defined from their correlation coefficient
as

\(d_{X,Y} = 1 - \rho_{X,Y}.\)
Considering that the Pearson correlation coefficient falls between [−1,
+1], the Pearson distance lies in [0, 2]. The Pearson distance has been
used in [[/wiki/Cluster_analysis][cluster analysis]] and data detection
for communications and storage with unknown gain and
offset

*** Circular correlation coefficient

Further information: [[/wiki/Circular_statistics][Circular statistics]]

For variables X = {/x/_{1},...,/x/_{/n/}} and Y =
{/y/_{1},...,/y/_{/n/}} that are defined on the unit circle [0, 2π), it
is possible to define a circular analog of Pearson's
coefficient. This is done by transforming
data points in X and Y with a [[/wiki/Sine][sine]] function such that
the correlation coefficient is given as:

\(r_{\text{circular}} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\sin(x_{i} - \overline{x})\sin(y_{i} - \overline{y})}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\sin(x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2}}\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\sin(y_{i} - \overline{y})^{2}}}\)
where
\(\overline{x}\)
and
\(\overline{y}\)
are the [[/wiki/Mean_of_circular_quantities][circular means]] of /X/
and /Y/. This measure can be useful in fields like meteorology where the
angular direction of data is important.

*** Partial
correlation[[[/w/index.php?title=Pearson_correlation_coefficient&action=edit&section=29][edit]]]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: partial-correlationedit
    :END:

Main article: [[/wiki/Partial_correlation][Partial correlation]]

If a population or data-set is characterized by more than two variables,
a [[/wiki/Partial_correlation][partial correlation]] coefficient
measures the strength of dependence between a pair of variables that is
not accounted for by the way in which they both change in response to
variations in a selected subset of the other variables.

** Decorrelation of /n/ random variables[[[/w/index.php?title=Pearson_correlation_coefficient&action=edit&section=30][edit]]]

Main article: [[/wiki/Decorrelation][Decorrelation]]

It is always possible to remove the correlations between all pairs of an
arbitrary number of random variables by using a data transformation,
even if the relationship between the variables is nonlinear. A
presentation of this result for population distributions is given by Cox
& Hinkley.

A corresponding result exists for reducing the sample correlations to
zero. Suppose a vector of /n/ random variables is observed /m/ times.
Let /X/ be a matrix where
\(X_{i,j}\)
is the /j/th variable of observation /i/. Let
\(Z_{m,m}\)
be an /m/ by /m/ square matrix with every element 1. Then /D/ is the
data transformed so every random variable has zero mean, and /T/ is the
data transformed so all variables have zero mean and zero correlation
with all other variables -- the sample
[[/wiki/Correlation_matrix][correlation matrix]] of /T/ will be the
identity matrix. This has to be further divided by the standard
deviation to get unit variance. The transformed variables will be
uncorrelated, even though they may not be
[[/wiki/Statistical_independence][independent]].

\(D = X - \frac{1}{m}Z_{m,m}X\)
\(T = D(D^{\mathsf{T}}D)^{- \frac{1}{2}},\)
where an exponent of −+1⁄2 represents the
[[/wiki/Matrix_square_root][matrix square root]] of the
[[/wiki/Matrix_inverse][inverse]] of a matrix. The correlation matrix of
/T/ will be the identity matrix. If a new data observation /x/ is a row
vector of /n/ elements, then the same transform can be applied to /x/ to
get the transformed vectors /d/ and /t/:

\(d = x - \frac{1}{m}Z_{1,m}X,\)[[
\(t = d(D^{\mathsf{T}}D)^{- \frac{1}{2}}.\)
This decorrelation is related to
[[/wiki/Principal_components_analysis][principal components analysis]]
for multivariate data.
