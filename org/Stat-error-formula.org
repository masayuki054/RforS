search (E error aov)



The difference between aov(depvar~timevar+Error(id)) and
aov(depvar~timevar+Error(id/timevar)) is whether or not you include
timevar as a random effect.

Note that there's more than one way to include a variable as a random
effect. You could also use aov(depvar~timevar+Error(id*timevar)) or
aov(depvar~timevar+Error(id + timevar)) as well. Each of these means
something quite different, but it can be confusing because they'll
often give you similar results when applied to the same dataset, due
to the constraints of the data themselves.

The slash / used in aov() denotes nesting. When you use /, R
automatically expands it to the main effect of the bottom variable
plus the interaction between the bottom and the top. For example, A/B
automatically expands to A + A:B. This is similar to how A*B
automatically expands to A + B + A:B, but with nesting, the variable
in the nest never appears outside of its nest (i.e. there can be no
main effect of B on its own).

You can see this expansion happening in your output:

> summary(aov(var~time1+Error(id / time1)))

The Error terms denote random effects. Notice you get one for the main
effect of id because it's the base of the nest, and one for the
interaction between id and time1, because time1 is nested within id
(you also get an Error effect for Within which is the basic residual
term for the model, i.e. the random effect of the individual
observations themselves).
